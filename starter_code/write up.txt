1) Temperature is high on equator and drops on north and south pole
2) Looking at the data Humidity in inversely proportional to Temperature.
As temperature rise, humidity drops and vice versa.
3) Cloudiness and Humidity is proportional. As cloudiness increase which increase
the saturation level and hence the humidity
